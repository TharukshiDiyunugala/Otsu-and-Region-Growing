# ðŸ§  Image Processing Assignment 2

This repository contains Python implementations of two image segmentation techniques for a take-home assignment.

## ðŸ“Œ Tasks

### 1. **Otsuâ€™s Thresholding with Gaussian Noise**
- A grayscale image is created with two objects and a background.
- Gaussian noise is added to simulate real-world conditions.
- Otsuâ€™s algorithm is used to automatically determine the optimal threshold and segment the image.

### 2. **Region Growing Algorithm**
- A region-growing segmentation technique is implemented.
- Starts from a seed point inside the object of interest.
- Recursively adds neighboring pixels that fall within a threshold range of pixel intensity.
